This assignment implements the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method using Python. The program takes an input CSV file containing alternatives and criteria values, along with user-defined weights and impacts, and ranks the alternatives based on their TOPSIS scores. The solution follows normalization, weighted scoring, distance calculation from ideal solutions, and ranking.
